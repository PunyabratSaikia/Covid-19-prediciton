# Covid-19-prediciton

We are exploring images of chests of patients to detect the presence of covid-19.
Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use
X-rays to analyze the health of a patientâ€™s lungs.

For this purpose we are building our model on Google Colab to give us the necessary computation power and easy access to all the required libraries.

Following are the step-by-step procedure of training our model:

1:Importing data-sets from google drive

2.Extracting the images from the datasets and resizing them.

3.Converting the images into matrices with the help of open CV and normalizing the pixel-intensities to 255.

4.Extracting the labels of the images and converting them to one-hot-encoded-vectors.

5.Splitting data randomly into 75% training and 25% testing data.

6.Building A VGG-neural network architecture, a well known deep-convolutional-neural network which performs well on image datasets.
More about VGG-architecture can be found in this link:https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-VGG-neural-network

7.Using adam's optimizer algorithm to reduce the loss of our cost function.

8.Predicting the labels our our test-data after the model  is trained.

9.Creating the confusion-matrix, analyzing the accuracy,precison,f1-score and other measures and plotting the training loss(and accuracy) against the testing loss(and testing accuracy).

10.We were able to achieve a good 92% accuracy on the test set.
